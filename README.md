# Linear-Model-Evaluation - Matlab-Deep-Inverse-Optimization

Framework to parse parameters between Matlab and Python to do Deep Inverse Optimization which is not available in the Matlab Optim Toolbox. The Deep Inverse Optimization code can be found here (https://github.com/tankconcordia/deep_inv_opt) described as an efficient way for tuning parameters is very necessary to evaluate and find correlation with empirical and  optimized forward models in Neuroscience.
