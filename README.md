# Linear-Model-Evaluation - Matlab-Deep-Inverse-Optimization

Framework to parse parameters between Matlab and Python to do Deep Inverse Optimization which is not available in the Matlab Optim Toolbox. The ![Deep Inverse Optimization](https://github.com/meiyor/Deep-Learning-Emotion-Decoding-using-EEG-data-from-Autism-individuals/blob/master/pipeline_2_using_latex.jpeg) described as an efficient way for tuning parameters is very necessary to evaluate and find correlation with empirical and  optimized forward models in Neuroscience.
